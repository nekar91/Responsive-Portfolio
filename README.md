# Responsive-Portfolio

This project is an attempt to create a website that showcases my web development portfolio.  I created three linked webpages, one with links to my portfolio, one with contact information, 
and one with general information about me.  

For this project, I used flex boxes, grids, containers and classes.  

I found this project fun, but difficult.
